                Imagine you have an idea to improve your product’s interface,
                but you’re not sure if it’s worth the time and money to
                implement.
              </p>
              <p>Well, there’s a solution: hallway testing!</p>
              <p>
                Hallway testing, also known as guerrilla testing, helps you
                validate your ideas in the early stages of development.
              </p>
              <h2 id="p2743869881237382">
                The major reasons to use hallway testing:
              </h2>
              <ul>
                <li>works quickly and efficiently;</li>
                <li>
                  better than not testing your product at all (if you lack the
                  research budget);
                </li>
                <li>validating or disproving early assumptions;</li>
                <li>
                  helps to identify areas that require a more thorough research.
                </li>
              </ul>

                We’ve got five super helpful recommendations for you to try out!
                Here are the steps:
              </p>
              <h2 id="p3485592076996367">1. Set clear goals</h2>
              <p>
                Think about what you want to learn or prove with the test. For
                example, “Do users understand how to use the new feature?” or
                “Does the new feature improve user engagement?” Once you’ve
                defined your goals and objectives, you can create a plan to test
                the feature and measure its success. This will help you focus on
                what you want to achieve and track the success metrics.
              </p>
              <h2 id="p16646590344425593">
                2. Get your feature ready for testing
              </h2>
              <p>
                Get your feature ready for testing by creating a sample version
                of it. Sometimes it doesn’t have to be perfect, but it should
                give test participants a good idea of what the feature does.
              </p>
              <h2 id="p5550578822127599">3. Select your participant</h2>
              <p>
                Pick people to take part in the test, target those, who are like
                your potential users: your work colleagues, friends, family, or
                social media followers. It’s important to have a mix of people
                with different backgrounds and expertise levels.
              </p>
              <h2 id="p10419723305902928">4. Test it out</h2>
              <p>
                Pick a time and place to conduct the test, either in-person or
                online. Let your participants try the feature and watch how they
                use it.<br />Encourage them to talk about their thoughts and
                feelings as they try it out. Note: record the test if you have a
                permission!<br />Collect feedback on what participants found
                helpful or frustrating.
              </p>
              <h2 id="p8470026610331036">5. Review the feedback</h2>
              <p>
                Once you have gathered the feedback, it’s important to review it
                thoroughly.<br />Look for common themes and issues that were
                noted by multiple participants. Identify the parts of the
                feature that need more work or testing and prioritize this
                improvements based on their impact on user experience and
                business goals. It’s also important to dig deeper into feedback
                that requires more context to be fully understand.<br />Overall,
                by reviewing feedback carefully, businesses can make informed
                decisions about how to improve the feature and deliver a better
                user experience.
              </p>
              <h2 id="p6932305633352914">Benefits for a business</h2>
              <p>
                By validating ideas in the early stages of development, you can
                save time and resources by avoiding costly mistakes down the
                road.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, hallway testing allows for quick and efficient
                testing, even with a limited or no research budget. It is also
                useful for identifying areas that require more thorough research
                and validating or disproving early assumptions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The method enables you to test your product with your unique
                target audience, ensuring that the feature meets their needs and
                preferences. This approach can result in a product that is more
                tailored for your users and better suited to your business
                goals.
