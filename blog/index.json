Here are the steps:</p><h2>1. Set clear goals</h2><p>Think about what you want to learn or prove with the test. For example, “Do users understand how to use the new feature?” or “Does the new feature improve user engagement?” Once you’ve defined your goals and objectives, you can create a plan to test the feature and measure its success. This will help you focus on what you want to achieve and track the success metrics.</p><h2>2. Get your feature ready for testing</h2><p>Get your feature ready for testing by creating a sample version of it. Sometimes it doesn’t have to be perfect, but it should give test participants a good idea of what the feature does.</p><h2>3. Select your participant</h2><p>Pick people to take part in the test, target those, who are like your potential users: your work colleagues, friends, family, or social media followers. It’s important to have a mix of people with different backgrounds and expertise levels.</p><h2>4. Test it out</h2><p>Pick a time and place to conduct the test, either in-person or online. Let your participants try the feature and watch how they use it.<br>Encourage them to talk about their thoughts and feelings as they try it out. Note: record the test if you have a permission!<br>Collect feedback on what participants found helpful or frustrating.</p><h2>5. Review the feedback</h2><p>Once you have gathered the feedback, it’s important to review it thoroughly.<br>Look for common themes and issues that were noted by multiple participants. Identify the parts of the feature that need more work or testing and prioritize this improvements based on their impact on user experience and business goals. It’s also important to dig deeper into feedback that requires more context to be fully understand.<br>Overall, by reviewing feedback carefully, businesses can make informed decisions about how to improve the feature and deliver a better user experience.</p><h2>Benefits for a business</h2><p>By validating ideas in the early stages of development, you can save time and resources by avoiding costly mistakes down the road.</p><p>Additionally, hallway testing allows for quick and efficient testing, even with a limited or no research budget. It is also useful for identifying areas that require more thorough research and validating or disproving early assumptions.</p><p>The method enables you to test your product with your unique target audience, ensuring that the feature meets their needs and preferences. This approach can result in a product that is more tailored for your users and better suited to your business goals.</p><h2>Thanks for reading 🇺🇦❤️</h2><p>If you ever need to develop a prototype or a design for your product, feel free to email us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@glow.team\">hello@glow.team</a>.

Develop a competence matrix and talk the candidate through their future professional development. Introduce them to the whole team, if teammates are located in different cities/countries — set up an informal online meeting.</li><li>Say no to extra paperwork! Create a basic list of FAQ. This will optimize work processes and save everyone’s time.</li><li>Always be open to feedback. Don’t forget about the intangible rewards for employees, this will show their value both personal and as part of the team. The negative feedback is even more important, it may highlight what needs to be improved.</li><li>Tell about business goals and engage the team to the realization of those goals. It will help the company to measure success and help the employees to feel involved and valued by the team, business, and clients.</li><li>Create a culture of honesty and transparency. Be straight with your employees and set a transparent mechanism for work and processes. Employees must always be sure that they can provide feedback and receive an honest answer.</li></ol><p>Employee experience is a collective responsibility because together you are stronger than alone.</p><p>If it seems to you that time came for changes inside the team and in personal EX — that’s true.

And you are correct but please, let me elaborate a little.</p><p>Regardless of whether you are launching a startup or trying to update an existing product — you must be sure to hire the right people. There are pros and cons in working with agencies as well as with individual freelancers and we want to dive into this specific topic.</p><p>Let’s build a situation: You have your own business, naturally, you want the business to grow and develop. However, at time you don’t have enough people, knowledge in some specifics, and definitely not enough time to control all the processes. It’s your business and you are already in charge of development, client communications, advertisement, hiring, legal, and financial issues.</p><p>This is a very common situation for most entrepreneurs. Eventually, you will come to a point where you need to scale up your business, attract more clients, or relaunch a product from scratch. In all of these cases, after a quick research, you will understand that it’s time for a new product design. A few more hours of surfing will show that “design” is a complex term and there are many specific fields inside of it. Just to name a few: product design, mobile apps design, illustration, animation, research methods and so much more.</p><p>After reading into the goals, differences in processes of each filed you can conclude that it’s not worth your time and it will be better to hire some specialists. You go to Google and soon enough u get to Dribbble, Behance, and Clutch. Here you can look through hundreds of profiles and portfolios. And there are so many of them and the prices have quite a range; some people promise a result, others brag about their cool processes, somebody is showing off their collaborations with Bentley, Google or Facebook. But, the main idea you will get from all these profiles is a simple division in two groups of specialists: freelancers and agencies.</p><h1>Who should I choose?</h1><figure><div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"><div><picture><source srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*1Sc5N2xdM94X09ybvPbRpg.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*1Sc5N2xdM94X09ybvPbRpg.jpeg 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/1*1Sc5N2xdM94X09ybvPbRpg.jpeg 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*1Sc5N2xdM94X09ybvPbRpg.jpeg 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*1Sc5N2xdM94X09ybvPbRpg.jpeg 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*1Sc5N2xdM94X09ybvPbRpg.jpeg 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*1Sc5N2xdM94X09ybvPbRpg.jpeg 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" type=\"image/webp\"><source data-testid=\"og\" srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*1Sc5N2xdM94X09ybvPbRpg.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*1Sc5N2xdM94X09ybvPbRpg.jpeg 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*1Sc5N2xdM94X09ybvPbRpg.jpeg 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/1*1Sc5N2xdM94X09ybvPbRpg.jpeg 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/1*1Sc5N2xdM94X09ybvPbRpg.jpeg 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/1*1Sc5N2xdM94X09ybvPbRpg.jpeg 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*1Sc5N2xdM94X09ybvPbRpg.jpeg 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"><img alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\"></picture></div></div></figure><p>A tough question right away, especially when you are not quite sure what you need. “I want a good design” is a very ambiguous thing to say. The lack of a documented detailed description of the product, list of competitors, or list of differences from existing products are all a common problem for startup entrepreneurs. You can’t aim for a good result if you don’t know what you are aiming for.</p><blockquote><p><em>Without a clear understanding there can be no clear result</em></p></blockquote><p>The first thing to consider is, of course, the price: agencies are always more expensive. And there are reasons for it: the staff, office rent, coffee machine maintenance, etc. On the other hand, there are freelancers — specialists who can work from anywhere provided with a laptop and a network connection. Let’s dig in some nuances:</p><p>Freelancers, most of the time, are a design one-man-army: a single person can make a you a website design, work with the layout, set up targeting, and give you many advices and recommendations.</p><p>Agencies do all of the above and a bit more but it costs three times the freelance price. “Why should I pay more?” you might ask. Because it gives more guarantees for you. Product design is a very complex field with different stages; let us list the main of them:<br>First, we schedule a discovery call when we get to know why and how your product works.<br>Then, we commit a deep research of your product and competitors.<br>With the information in hand, we create a Customer Journey Map (CJM) to help us understand how users are going to use your product.<br>Afterwards is the wireframe stage full of black and white images but, when done correctly, this stage can help you save hundreds of thousands of dollars and tens of hours of your time.<br>All of the above will result in a well thought concept of how your product will look like.</p><p>In terms of planning and result guarantees agencies have the upper hand. Hiring an agency the customer can be sure that a specialist will handle each field. The copywriter will provide quality text; the marketer will set up advertisement; SEO-specialist will promote the site; programmers will write the code for new features; designers will work through the stages listed above (and do much more). Also it is important that a project manager will be the captain of this crew — being the link between client requests and agency tasks completion.</p><h1>I want to save time and money</h1><figure><div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"><div><picture><source srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*CrJruQOjgI9fzRnYSGCMMw.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*CrJruQOjgI9fzRnYSGCMMw.jpeg 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/1*CrJruQOjgI9fzRnYSGCMMw.jpeg 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*CrJruQOjgI9fzRnYSGCMMw.jpeg 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*CrJruQOjgI9fzRnYSGCMMw.jpeg 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*CrJruQOjgI9fzRnYSGCMMw.jpeg 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*CrJruQOjgI9fzRnYSGCMMw.jpeg 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" type=\"image/webp\"><source data-testid=\"og\" srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*CrJruQOjgI9fzRnYSGCMMw.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*CrJruQOjgI9fzRnYSGCMMw.jpeg 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*CrJruQOjgI9fzRnYSGCMMw.jpeg 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/1*CrJruQOjgI9fzRnYSGCMMw.jpeg 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/1*CrJruQOjgI9fzRnYSGCMMw.jpeg 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/1*CrJruQOjgI9fzRnYSGCMMw.jpeg 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*CrJruQOjgI9fzRnYSGCMMw.jpeg 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"><img alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\"></picture></div></div></figure><p>Freelancers will be enough for some tasks but hiring a freelancer always come with some risks. If you are not satisfied with the work done by a specialist and you decide to change them, will the newcomer have the knowledge about all the work done by their predecessor? For instance, the newcomer has no information on the committed audience testing and the results of what works better and what does not work at all. That might drive the newcomer to start the process all over again and replicate the mistakes already fixed by their predecessor.</p><p>Also, bringing a new specialist to the project takes a lot of time. The newcomer must relearn all the details and get to know their colleagues. We must not forget that we are all human beings and can get ill; in case of freelance, it results in delays. It is much more common for freelancers to drop out of projects. In addition, for a company each change of personnel means a re-sign of contracts and NDAs, production and adjustment of the new strategy and many more time-consuming steps.</p><blockquote><p><em>All of it takes time, your time.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>There are other serious concerns when hiring a freelancer:</strong></p><ul><li>Low competence — the market is flooded with specialists who have just finished some sort of courses but recognize themselves as top-notch;</li><li>Lack of big picture — freelancers work in their narrow specialty;</li><li>Personal control — you’ll need to guide the specialist yourself or assign them to one of your project managers;</li><li>Work ethics — some freelancers tend to stop responding to texts and show up a few days later thinking that’s no big deal.</li></ul><h1>I want my business to grow and bring more profit</h1><figure><div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"><div><picture><source srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*tZs0ibfzYBv6DY90vH5mmA.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*tZs0ibfzYBv6DY90vH5mmA.jpeg 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/1*tZs0ibfzYBv6DY90vH5mmA.jpeg 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*tZs0ibfzYBv6DY90vH5mmA.jpeg 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*tZs0ibfzYBv6DY90vH5mmA.jpeg 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*tZs0ibfzYBv6DY90vH5mmA.jpeg 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*tZs0ibfzYBv6DY90vH5mmA.jpeg 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" type=\"image/webp\"><source data-testid=\"og\" srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*tZs0ibfzYBv6DY90vH5mmA.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*tZs0ibfzYBv6DY90vH5mmA.jpeg 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*tZs0ibfzYBv6DY90vH5mmA.jpeg 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/1*tZs0ibfzYBv6DY90vH5mmA.jpeg 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/1*tZs0ibfzYBv6DY90vH5mmA.jpeg 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/1*tZs0ibfzYBv6DY90vH5mmA.jpeg 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*tZs0ibfzYBv6DY90vH5mmA.jpeg 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"><img alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\"></picture></div></div></figure><p>To avoid all the concerns from the previous paragraph it is best to hire an agency.

As our country is.</p><p>No wonder we took tattoo outlines as inspiration for our illustration.</p><figure><div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"><div><picture><source srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/0*YtNUKe1zCSIGNYuX 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/0*YtNUKe1zCSIGNYuX 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/0*YtNUKe1zCSIGNYuX 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/0*YtNUKe1zCSIGNYuX 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/0*YtNUKe1zCSIGNYuX 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/0*YtNUKe1zCSIGNYuX 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*YtNUKe1zCSIGNYuX 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" type=\"image/webp\"><source data-testid=\"og\" srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/0*YtNUKe1zCSIGNYuX 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/0*YtNUKe1zCSIGNYuX 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/0*YtNUKe1zCSIGNYuX 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/0*YtNUKe1zCSIGNYuX 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/0*YtNUKe1zCSIGNYuX 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/0*YtNUKe1zCSIGNYuX 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*YtNUKe1zCSIGNYuX 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"><img alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\"></picture></div></div></figure><p>Colors for the illustration were chosen from the colors of the logo with addition of yellow and red.

You own a company that sells books. You have a wide range of choices, from all publishing companies in all languages. The analytics show that a lot of people visit your website. Some of them surf the pages, choose and add products to the chart. However, only a few proceed with the actual purchase. So, what is the issue? Where should you start looking?</p><p>That’s when the audit comes into play!</p><p>First of all, it helps find usability problems. The goal is to see the common issues that stand in the way of users’ paths — like, for example, ordering and paying for a book. How to make it in just three clicks?</p><p>The visual appearance of your product (UI) is another significant aspect that is often underestimated. Why the aesthetic side is crucial, you can <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/aesthetic-usability-effect/#:~:text=Definition%3A%20The%20aesthetic%2Dusability%20effect,actually%20more%20effective%20or%20efficient.\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>learn</strong></a> from these guys.</p><p>Back to the bookstore. Is the visual design coherent across all categories and stages? Can the client see the checkout page or there is a mix of colors around that disturb him?</p><p>The third point. A well-founded audit is a tool to improve the overall user experience, make it convenient and increase customer retention in one shot. Thus, as the owner of a bookstore, you deliver the best book choice for each customer.</p><h1><strong>Is it worth doing for my business?</strong></h1><figure><div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"><div><picture><source srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*UXQ9ZWWSAlb0_gosC8f0Vw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*UXQ9ZWWSAlb0_gosC8f0Vw.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/1*UXQ9ZWWSAlb0_gosC8f0Vw.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*UXQ9ZWWSAlb0_gosC8f0Vw.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*UXQ9ZWWSAlb0_gosC8f0Vw.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*UXQ9ZWWSAlb0_gosC8f0Vw.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*UXQ9ZWWSAlb0_gosC8f0Vw.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" type=\"image/webp\"><source data-testid=\"og\" srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*UXQ9ZWWSAlb0_gosC8f0Vw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*UXQ9ZWWSAlb0_gosC8f0Vw.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*UXQ9ZWWSAlb0_gosC8f0Vw.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/1*UXQ9ZWWSAlb0_gosC8f0Vw.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/1*UXQ9ZWWSAlb0_gosC8f0Vw.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/1*UXQ9ZWWSAlb0_gosC8f0Vw.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*UXQ9ZWWSAlb0_gosC8f0Vw.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"><img alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"201\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\"></picture></div></div></figure><p>It may be really surprising for you. The audit is suitable for both start-ups and big enterprise companies. The benefits for start-ups include preventing all possible mistakes at the very beginning of a project while bringing a positive experience for end-users. At the same time, big enterprises may get rid of any burdens or barriers that hinder them from taking over the world and making it a better place to live!</p><p>Okay, but what if you may have noticed some issues with the product. Don’t follow that misleading hope that it will sort itself out, or your income will get sufficient over time. Ignoring the problem might cause losing even more clients and income accordingly.</p><p>It might seem that such unnecessary things as audits will only waste your money and time. However, it’s actually the opposite: the audit helps you reveal the most painful issues that slipped out of your focus otherwise. At least, it will save several loyal clients and increase some revenue on the top.</p><h1><strong>Where do we start?</strong></h1><figure><div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"><div><picture><source srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*etqcU4OtjHbgG6oDCMNZrg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*etqcU4OtjHbgG6oDCMNZrg.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/1*etqcU4OtjHbgG6oDCMNZrg.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*etqcU4OtjHbgG6oDCMNZrg.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*etqcU4OtjHbgG6oDCMNZrg.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*etqcU4OtjHbgG6oDCMNZrg.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*etqcU4OtjHbgG6oDCMNZrg.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" type=\"image/webp\"><source data-testid=\"og\" srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*etqcU4OtjHbgG6oDCMNZrg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*etqcU4OtjHbgG6oDCMNZrg.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*etqcU4OtjHbgG6oDCMNZrg.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/1*etqcU4OtjHbgG6oDCMNZrg.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/1*etqcU4OtjHbgG6oDCMNZrg.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/1*etqcU4OtjHbgG6oDCMNZrg.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*etqcU4OtjHbgG6oDCMNZrg.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"><img alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"201\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\"></picture></div></div></figure><p><strong>Ask these three questions:</strong></p><ul><li>What challenges do customers face using the product?</li><li>How do those challenges affect customer behavior?</li><li>Where is the moment when users give up and leave the product?</li></ul><p>Fortunately, you can find and examine all the problems by using various audit methods — website and graphic <strong>design, UI, </strong>and <strong>UX approaches.</strong></p><h1><strong>And what does the process look like?</strong></h1><p>Previously, we discovered why.

We are learning which problems are enlisted and identifying the desired outcomes.</p><p>This step may vary. If it’s an existing product, we dive into analytics, define the target audience and take look at conversion rates, user flows, page clicks, and interactions. While with a start-up, we insist on conducting in-depth research on the market, competitors, potential customers, and their needs.</p><h2><strong>Step 2.</strong> — <strong>Magic Design</strong></h2><p>So, what is “magic”? The data collected before is analyzed and used to determine weak spots. We create and define hypotheses to test with real users who give feedback on the product’s usability. Eventually, that’s how we find design flaws and malfunctions.</p><h1><strong>What audit techniques do we usually use?</strong></h1><h2><strong>UX audit</strong></h2><p>We examine each screen in detail, describing the problem areas.

Owners of electric vehicles face a lot of challenges with charging whether it’s a short trip to work or long road trips between the cities. That is why we decided to create a concept of an application that solves the problems of charging and direction to the desired destination. Our main goal was to provide the user with the best route by analyzing battery level to prevent unexpected problems on the road. Application allows you to use contactless payment and see the charging points along the route with ability to book the station.</p><p><strong>Competitors</strong></p><p>The ground work began with the creation of the logo and distinct style. Following the idea of a map application, we researched the competitors in the industry to find a niche for electric car owners. Plugs, sockets, batteries and other visual elements were obvious for us and made us take a deeper look at the potential logo.</p><figure><div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"><div><picture><source

Does it mean that they are open to innovations? Not at all. Here are some reasons why their owners are not eager to break the conventional system.</p><ul><li>An off-street car parking is a complicated system and a territory with a lot of players.</li><li>Most people seek a parking spot not until they have got to the place.</li><li>The majority of parking lot owners rely on live operators, not automatic equipment.</li></ul><p>But we decided to get things moving.</p><h2><strong>What is the problem from the point of view of a car driver?</strong></h2><p>Take you, for instance, or an everyman on a self-quarantine. Like most people, you are likely to stay at home and think of what to do. But as long as a week ago, you used to get into your Tesla Cybertruck every morning, chauffeur your children to school, and hurry to the office. What did it look like?</p><p>You got to the office, and now you are seeking a spot where you can park your car without the fear of being fined or getting to a car impound. But there’s no room for your Cybertruck, which, unfortunately, can’t fly. After five circles around the block, you, finally, find a place and go work, ‘blessing’ the whole system. On the next day, everything repeats.</p><blockquote><p>It is estimated that car drivers all over the world, on average, lose 20 minutes searching for a parking spot.</p></blockquote><p>What about vacations? Let’s assume you’ve bought flight tickets, loaded your family into a car, and now you are rushing to the airport. Before the departure, you are likely to give the car keys to a parking lot manager and leave for a vacation. But you have no idea of what happens to your car while you are away…</p><p>In our article, we’ll have a closer look at the life of parking lot operators and add efficiency to their routine workflow.</p><h2><strong>These are John and Jim</strong></h2><p>John is a parking lot manager. He accepts, controls, and releases the cars. Every morning, just like you, he wakes up and goes to work by his Hyundai Accent. He wants to work less and get more money for it.</p><p>His typical working day includes a huge volume of work. To accept your car he has to meet you, walk to the office with you, fill out paperwork, suggest you extra services (car washing, recharging, interior cleaning, etc.). John must take the keys, inspect the car, and deliver it to a parking spot. It means he has to drive around the whole parking lot (see yourself?) find a place for your car, write down the level, section, and the parking spot number. And we don’t mention the procedure of realizing the car!</p><p>At the same time, Jim pounds a beat. He walks around three levels, ten sections, and over a thousand parking spots. He walks with a sheet of paper and a pencil over his ear, as he needs to report on an overall occupancy of the parking lot, problems and challenges.</p><h2><strong>Let’s try to make the life of John and Jim a little bit simpler?</strong></h2><p>When we know what load these guys (parking operators) have every day, we want to find a solution as soon as possible.</p><p>We at Glow have designed an admin panel for parking management. It is adapted for iPad, as a tablet will let John and Jim stay mobile. The product includes all the features that employees can need — from the monitoring of reservations and services to checking a parking slot status and its device.</p></div></div><div><figure><picture><source srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*ESP2H_4-iGNKrBpm7r9fNg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*ESP2H_4-iGNKrBpm7r9fNg.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/1*ESP2H_4-iGNKrBpm7r9fNg.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*ESP2H_4-iGNKrBpm7r9fNg.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*ESP2H_4-iGNKrBpm7r9fNg.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*ESP2H_4-iGNKrBpm7r9fNg.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*ESP2H_4-iGNKrBpm7r9fNg.png 4800w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 100vw\" type=\"image/webp\"><source data-testid=\"og\" srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*ESP2H_4-iGNKrBpm7r9fNg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*ESP2H_4-iGNKrBpm7r9fNg.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*ESP2H_4-iGNKrBpm7r9fNg.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/1*ESP2H_4-iGNKrBpm7r9fNg.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/1*ESP2H_4-iGNKrBpm7r9fNg.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/1*ESP2H_4-iGNKrBpm7r9fNg.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/1*ESP2H_4-iGNKrBpm7r9fNg.png 4800w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 100vw\"><img alt=\"\" width=\"2400\" height=\"2491\" loading=\"eager\" role=\"presentation\"></picture></figure></div><div><div><h2><strong>What should we start from?</strong></h2><p>To automate the workflow of these operators we need to start from the main object — the parking lot itself.</p><p>Each parking lot is a unique object, which can contain several levels, dozens of sections, and thousands of parking slots.</p><p>How can we transfer the parking lot into a digital format?

Several lengthy iterations — and we’ve got the very plan that our operators know from A to Z.</p><p>To make the navigation around section more convenient we added small areas from both sides. These are so-called shortcuts for switching between the sections. After 15 minutes of debating, we added the location of the company’s office.</p><p>As the employees have to switch between the sections quite frequently, we added the option of a fast view of a parking slot details. As they say, right off the bat. It allows checking a park slot details without the need of switching between the pages and open new tabs.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div role=\"button\"

all bookings on the Dashboard page. For this task, we created a separate screen with a possibility to sort by status, type, and date. All new bookings are automatically added to the chart, once a client has booked a slot on the public version of the website. Also, an operator can add new booking manually.</p><p>To make the reading of booking details more comfortable we used colored tags, which help check the status quickly. Also, we added information about the car (a model and a number).</p><p>After a quick search of the needed booking, an employee can open the details and find information about the transaction. For example, one can check whether the client entered his payment details, whether he ordered extra services for his car, at what stage the booking currently is, and so on.</p><p>One of the most important features on this page is the parking slot assignment. Long before the client gets to the place, employees find a spare slot on a car parking lot and make a reservation.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"><div><picture><source srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*XIJTBVda69OjaEvNRnr5DA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*XIJTBVda69OjaEvNRnr5DA.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/1*XIJTBVda69OjaEvNRnr5DA.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*XIJTBVda69OjaEvNRnr5DA.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*XIJTBVda69OjaEvNRnr5DA.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*XIJTBVda69OjaEvNRnr5DA.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*XIJTBVda69OjaEvNRnr5DA.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 1000px\" type=\"image/webp\"><source data-testid=\"og\" srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*XIJTBVda69OjaEvNRnr5DA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*XIJTBVda69OjaEvNRnr5DA.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*XIJTBVda69OjaEvNRnr5DA.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/1*XIJTBVda69OjaEvNRnr5DA.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/1*XIJTBVda69OjaEvNRnr5DA.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/1*XIJTBVda69OjaEvNRnr5DA.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*XIJTBVda69OjaEvNRnr5DA.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 1000px\"><img alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"740\" loading=\"eager\" role=\"presentation\"></picture></div></div></figure></div></div></div><div><div><h2><strong>The Time of Innovations</strong></h2><p>Once the car is parked, a parking sensor appears on the scene.</p><p>This unique technical development lets save quite a lot of person-hours. The sensor looks like a small device that is attached to the floor on every parking slot. Once a car gets to its place, the system automatically “understands” that this slot is taken. After that, the booking is automatically transferred to the stage “Car is Parked”. By doing so, the sensor significantly simplifies the process of car accepting and releasing. Besides, Jim won’t have to walk around the parking lot all the time and check the load.</p><p>In the case of a sensor failure or low battery, the system automatically sends a notification and displays it on the screen.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"><div><picture><source srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*1FJm4PByzrM6ecQMAXlOhw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*1FJm4PByzrM6ecQMAXlOhw.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/1*1FJm4PByzrM6ecQMAXlOhw.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*1FJm4PByzrM6ecQMAXlOhw.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*1FJm4PByzrM6ecQMAXlOhw.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*1FJm4PByzrM6ecQMAXlOhw.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*1FJm4PByzrM6ecQMAXlOhw.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 1000px\" type=\"image/webp\"><source data-testid=\"og\" srcSet=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*1FJm4PByzrM6ecQMAXlOhw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*1FJm4PByzrM6ecQMAXlOhw.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*1FJm4PByzrM6ecQMAXlOhw.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/1*1FJm4PByzrM6ecQMAXlOhw.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/1*1FJm4PByzrM6ecQMAXlOhw.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/1*1FJm4PByzrM6ecQMAXlOhw.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*1FJm4PByzrM6ecQMAXlOhw.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 1000px\"><img alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"740\" loading=\"eager\" role=\"presentation\"></picture></div></div></figure></div></div></div><div><div><h2><strong>The Schedule of Services</strong></h2><p>The system has a built-in calendar, which lets employees track all the future services scheduled for the current day/week/month.
